Python scripts used for practicing purposes for module Data Structures & Algorithms

CW1,CW2,CW3 - Courework 1,2 & 3 respectively. 



MODULE DESCRIPTION

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental to programming and to understanding computation. The aim of this module is to provide you with a coherent introduction to techniques for using data structures and some basic algorithms. Teaching and learning methods include lectures and reading materials describing techniques for analysing algorithms and applications of data structures. You will have an opportunity to examine practical problem solving for this area.
