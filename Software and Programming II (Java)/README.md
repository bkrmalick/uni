MODULE DESCRIPTION

This module is a continuation of the studies presented in Software and Programming I focusing on an introduced to the use of object-oriented methods for problem solving. Object-oriented programming languages require a different approach to software design from the traditional functional decomposition approach of procedural languages. Object-oriented systems are described in terms of independent objects, and their inter-relationships. Such systems can provide considerable potential for re-usability, extensibility, and robustness, assisting in the process of programming-in-the-large.
